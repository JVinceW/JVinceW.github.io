<h2 id="studying-graphic-programming-wip">Studying Graphic programming (WIP)</h2>

<p>In addition to my work in ECS, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with an incredible team of industry veterans who have contributed to major projects such as the FF series, CyberPunk, Bayonetta, and more. This unique opportunity has ignited my passion for graphic programming, and while I’m still in the learning process, I haven’t documented my journey extensively. However, I can provide an overview of what I’ve been working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Following the tutorials on learnopengl.com to build a solid foundation of essential graphic programming knowledge.</li>
  <li>Conducting in-depth analyses of Unreal Engine’s rendering pipeline, texture formats, shaders, and command buffers, with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of advanced graphics concepts and techniques.</li>
</ul>
